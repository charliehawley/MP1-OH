                    On July 25th, 2020, people all over the world filmed their lives and shared their stories to be part of a documentary film. When all the submissions were tallied, the filmmakers had received over 300,000 videos from 192 countries.

                <p>
                    The result is a stirring film about love, death, heartbreak, and hope that looks beyond geography and circumstance to explore what connects us as humans.

                    An unlikely team, seemingly insurmountable odds, even explosions… taking steps towards a future in which money works for us all.

                <p>
                    This mischievous feature documentary led by artist/filmmaker team Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell, instigates and follows a community coming together to make their own currency, opening a bank in order to examine how money and debt is created in our economy and to ask important questions about how the system of money creation might be altered in their favour.

                    In the second week of March 2021, with the country still in lockdown, I set out to film each morning of low tide under the Hastings Pier. Bleak mornings as such are predominantly populated by hardy dog walkers with lively dogs and bait collectors reliant on the low tide.

                <p>
                    Throughout lockdown, I've been documenting how people interact with the beach at different times and in different conditions. I'm interested in how place is shaped by the human interactions that transiently inhabit it. By situating the pier as the protagonist, initially erected in 1872, place is firmly stated as the enduring feature.
