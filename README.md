# MP-1 Olivia Hird Professional Portfolio

This project will endeavour to present and reflect the work, ethos and acumen of Olivia Hird, a filmmaker, production manager, researcher, cameraperson and writer for documentary film and festivals. 
This website will provide a platform for her to demonstrate previous and current work in a style that reflects her methodologies and aesthetic inclination.

### Strategy

The fundamental goal of this website is to make Olivia's details available and her experience apparent as well as showcasing her acumen and drive as an individual through her personal work.
___
### Scope

The minimum viable product for this project necessitates:

- embedded videos (hosted remotely) which populate a portfolio

- contact details and a form to further facilitate correspondence

- links to essays and reviews (hosted remotely and locally) as well as links to social profiles

Animations are implemented on the Writing cards that show excerpts of the written work on hover.

#### Future features

I would also like to add a feature to allow users to switch between Factual and Personal work channels on the landing page video but this.
___
### Structure

Each webpage features a navigation bar fixed to the left, a header fixed to the top and a footer, also fixed to the bottom to create a windowed effect and standardize the experience across all facets of the site. 

___
### Skeleton

The user can navigate between four pages:
- a landing page (Home) 
- an About page with contact details and a form 
- a Portfolio page with a video and short description for each project
- a Writing page which will contain links to reviews and essays

All pages can always be accessed from the fixed nav bar.

Most common paths:
- Home > About > Portfolio
- Home > About > Writing
- Home > Socials

Contact details are included on every page so that a user never needs to interrupt the content they might be watching/reading to open a correspondence.
