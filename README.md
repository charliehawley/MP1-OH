# MP-1 Olivia Hird Professional Portfolio

This project will endeavour to present and reflect the work, ethos and acumen of Olivia Hird, a filmmaker, production manager, researcher, cameraperson and writer for documentary film and festivals. 
This website will provide a platform for her to demonstrate previous and current work in a style that reflects her methodologies and aesthetic inclination.
This in turn will enable Olivia to direct prospective employers towards her work and allow those she works with a comprehensive frame of reference.

* It will include:
    * examples of previous work in video, image and essay formats
    * statement of intent and interests
    * details on her previous experience
    * social links
    * contact details

* It will serve to: 
    * direct traffic to articles already hosted around the web and articles not yet hosted elsewhere
    * showcase directorial and editorial capability within production and the edit respectively
    * detail organisational strengths accrued through festival work

#### User stories

- As the producer of a film festival, I wish to gain an understanding of Olivia's past experience and potential in order to properly consider her for the role of production manager/programmer/preselector.

- As the producer of a film festival, I would like to verify whether Olivia's previous film reviews and essays are of the correct standard to grant Olivia a press pass to our festival.

- As a producer for a feature documentary, I would like to see a list of Olivia's previous experience in order to consider her for a role as researcher on my upcoming project.

- As a documentary filmmaker, I would like to see examples of Olivia's previous work to better understand her aesthetic and compositional strength in camera work.

- As the editor of an online film journal, I would like to verify that Olivia's writing is of the correct standard and quality to grant her request to write for us.

### Strategy

The fundamental aim for this website is to make Olivia's details available and her experience apparent as well as showcasing her acumen and drive as an individual through her personal work.

### Scope

The minimum viable product for this project will necessitate:

* embedded videos (hosted remotely) which will populate a portfolio

* contact details and a form to further facilitate correspondence

* links to essays and reviews (hosted remotely and locally) as well as links to social profiles

I would like to implement animations on the writing cards that show excerpts on hover.

### Structure

Each webpage will feature a navigation bar fixed to the left. It will feature a landing page (Home), an About page with contact details and a form, a Portfolio page with videos of previous work and a short description and finally a Writing page which will contain links to reviews and essays.
